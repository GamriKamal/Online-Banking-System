# Online-Banking-System
Hello everyone, to your attention is my small project called Online Banking System
In this project, I decided to apply and hone my skills in using Spring Boot and creating REST applications using the MVC template and also using JSP files.
In my project there is a table called Account. It contains several fields that are related to the banking topic. Next, I have a repository for my class, a service class, and a controller class.

Using the controller class, I can handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
My project is available at http://localhost:8080/onlineBank. This is the main menu.

You can also use various tools to work with the API to send requests to the following address:
http://localhost:8080/accounts
